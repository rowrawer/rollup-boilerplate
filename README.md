## The Rollup Boilerplate

### What is this?

This is my boilerplate for any basic project involving HTML, JS, and CSS files. Provides a sanely optimized, minified bundle using Rollup with plugins for Babel, PostCSS, and HTMLMinifier. Includes a dev server with live reload.

### What's the point?

Having a boilerplate tailored to my preferences and available for immediate use - simply clone, install, and start coding - allows me to be more efficient, ensuring I don't waste time setting up a bundler every time, even for the most rudimentary project.

### How do I launch this myself?

1. `git clone https://github.com/rowrawer/rollup-boilerplate .`
2. `npm i`
3. `npm start` to start coding
4. `npm run build` to create minified bundle
